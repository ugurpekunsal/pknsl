		"bio": "I came to Canada from Turkey on my own in 2013 when I was 16. That same year, our high school got a new computer science teacher from Waterloo University. My first experience with coding started from there and continued on through college and my personal life. Now I am a web developer at The Portal Connector, where I am one of many highly qualified engineers that produce sophisticated but user friendly CRM systems. In the near future I want to become a valued member of the company and make a strong and visible, positive impact. My primary goal is to propel The Portal Connector to grow consistently while maintaining first class quality and client satisfaction.",
