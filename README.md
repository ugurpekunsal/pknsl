### Installation

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/pknsl.git
cd pknsl
```

## Setting Up the Contact Form

The contact form uses [Resend](https://resend.com) to send emails. To set it up:

1. Sign up for a free Resend account at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Create an API key in the Resend dashboard
3. Add your API key to the environment variables:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project with the following variables:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxx
EMAIL_FROM=your-verified-domain@example.com
EMAIL_TO=your-email@example.com
```

Notes:

- For `EMAIL_FROM`, you need to use a domain you've verified with Resend, or use the default `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing
- `EMAIL_TO` is where you'll receive contact form submissions

### Deploying to Vercel

When deploying to Vercel, add the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
3. Add the same variables as above:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - `EMAIL_FROM`
   - `EMAIL_TO`
